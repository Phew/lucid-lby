# Lucid LBY Edition

## This is more of a learning project for me, as I don't really know that much C++. 
### This will be a continuation of my earlier P2C Lucidity that I shut down almost a year ago.

## TODO
```bash
Fake Flick > Fake Flick Fix, Add Fake Flick

Resolver > add more checks, imrpove last moving lby and anti-freestand (idk how good no-spread resolver is atm)

```
