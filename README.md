# Lucid LBY Edition

## This is more of a learning project for me, as I don't really know that much C++. 
### This will be a continuation of my earlier P2C Lucidity that I shut down almost a year ago.

## TODO
```bash
Fake Flick > Fake Flick Fix, Add Fake Flick
Lag-Walk > Fix direction keys, improve overall
Resolver > add more checks, improve last moving lby and anti-freestand (idk how good no-spread resolver is atm)
Visuals > Various visual shit
Menu > New menu????
```
